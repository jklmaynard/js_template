JAVASCRIPT TEMPLATE PROGRAM

This is just a filing system for Epicodus Week 6.  All the necessary files, including mocha and chai .js are already uploaded. THis is just a shortcut so I don't have to go searching the internet for all the files, keeping downloading/uploading. Instead this offers a template (and now, a repository) for all those files.
